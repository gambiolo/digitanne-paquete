"Yes even if am a machine I have a soul...inna shell ok... but still. I weight less than 25kilos and I run on lithium battery, I'm equipped with a retroprojector, a sound system and an arduino that emits information everywhere I go, I am a sort of digital mule, a cyber middle age caravan of mediated matter."
