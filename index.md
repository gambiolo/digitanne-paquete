# Hi am Digitanne the bike messenger 

"Yes even if am a machine I have a soul...inna shell ok... but still, I run on lithium battery and I'm equipped with a retroprojector, a sound system and an arduino that emits information everywhere I go, I am a sort of digital mule, a cyber middle age messenger, a caravan of mediated matter."

"Am originally designed for agile farmer communities. I usualy come with a charette and a ton of information on how to take care of me, information like how to code me, and how to make your community the more autonomous possible.

Farmers are technical people but they dont need high technologies in the fields. They need lightweigh, agile and reliable tools like me to make their, soil wet and humid. also am totally silencious and can be the perfect companion to hunt with a bow and arrows"
